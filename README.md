# Battle Ready app
This is a react app with a Django server and a postgresql database.  It is all hosted locally.  The app interacts with two APIs that both contain superhero data. One of the APIs is used to list the characters and the other os used to search.  While going through the database the user is able to add characters to player one or player 2 slot and save the match to our database.  once the match is pulled up there are nested ternary operators that compare the stats. The user can also choose from backgrounds, both stages and matches have full crud.  

## Challenges
Version control was probably one of the biggest challenges.  It seemed that every time we had a merge there were a handful of bugs that needed to be corrected. The app as it is has a few of these bugs remaining, like the search error coming up on the page before anything has been searched.  Adding the matches is not intuitive.  In the future I would like to see components and state changes more neatly organized.  

## Successes
It was cool to be able to see all the code come together with each merge.  All of the merge conflicts and bugs they produced seemed to help us understand git hub more and more.
